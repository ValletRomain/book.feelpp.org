[[installation]]
== Installation Quick Start

Using {feelpp} inside Docker is the recommended and fastest way to use {feelpp}.

We strongly encourage you to follow the xref:install:containers.adoc#_docker[Docker installation steps] if you begin with {feelpp} in particular as an end-user.

[[usage]]
== Usage Quick Start

Start the main {feelpp} Docker container feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes` as follows

.Command line to start the docker container
[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -it --rm -e LOCAL_USER_ID=`id -u $USER`  -v $HOME/feel:/feel feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes
----
TIP: simply copy-paste the command line in your terminal to start the `feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes` container.

Here are some explanations about the different parts in the command line
[source,sh]
----
$ docker <1>
  run <2>
  -it <3>
  --rm <4>
  -e LOCAL_USER_ID=`id -u`<5>
  -v $HOME/feel:/feel <6>
  feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes <7>
----
<1> `docker` is the application that allows to create and execute Containers
<2> `run` allows to execute the image `feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes`
<3> the option `-it` runs Docker in interactive mode;
<4> the option `--rm` makes sure that the container is deleted after the user exits Docker
<5> we need to pass your user id to Docker so that the data you generate from Docker belongs to you;
<6> maps the directory `$HOME/feel` on your host to `/feel` in Docker, {feelpp} write in `/feel` the results of the simulations. Passing your id, _i.e_ `LOCAL_USER_ID`, allows to ensure that the generated data on {feelpp} belongs to you on your host system;
<7> execute the image `feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes` and create the associated container .

Then run _e.g._ the {uri-rel-file-base}/feelpp/quickstart/qs_laplacian.cpp[Quickstart Laplacian] that solves the Laplacian problem in <<lap-seq>> or in <<lap-par>>.

TIP: Several testcases (configuration files) have been installed in `/feel/testcases` (in Docker container) or `$HOME/feel/testcases` once you have executed the command line above.

[[lap-seq]]
[source,sh]
.Running the quickstart Laplacian in sequential
----
$ feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file /feel/testcases/quickstart/laplacian/feelpp2d/feelpp2d.cfg
----

[[lap-seq-explanations]]
[source,sh]
.Explanations about running the quickstart Laplacian in sequential
----
> feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d <1>
--config-file /feel/testcases/quickstart/laplacian/feelpp2d/feelpp2d.cfg<2>
----
<1> executable to run
<2> configuration file (text) to setup the problem : mesh, material properties and boundary conditions

The results are stored in Docker in
----
/feel/qs_laplacian/feelpp2d/np_1/exports/ensightgold/qs_laplacian/
----
and on your computer
----
$HOME/feel/qs_laplacian/feelpp2d/np_1/exports/ensightgold/qs_laplacian/
----
The mesh and solutions can be visualized using _e.g._ Paraview or Visit.

[TIP]

link:https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit[Visit]:: is a distributed, parallel visualization and graphical analysis tool for data defined on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) meshes
====

[[lap-par]]
[source,sh]
.Quickstart Laplacian on 4 cores in parallel
----
> mpirun -np 4 feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file /feel/testcases/quickstart/laplacian/feelpp2d/feelpp2d.cfg
----

The results are stored in a simular place as above: just replace `np_1` by `np_4` in the paths above. The results should look like

[[syntax]]
== Syntax Start

Here are some  excerpts from {uri-rel-file-base}/feelpp/quickstart/qs_laplacian.cpp[Quickstart Laplacian] that solves the Laplacian problem. It shows some of the features of {feelpp} and in particular the domain specific language for Galerkin methods.

First we load the mesh, define the function space define some expressions
[source,cpp]
.Laplacian problem in an arbitrary geometry, loading mesh and defining spaces
----
include::cpp:example$laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tags=mesh_space]
----

Second we define the linear and bilinear forms to solve the problem

[source,cpp]
.Laplacian problem in an arbitrary geometry, defining forms and solving
----
include::cpp:example$laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tags=forms]
----

More explanations are available in xref:user:cpp:laplacian.adoc[the Laplacian example].
