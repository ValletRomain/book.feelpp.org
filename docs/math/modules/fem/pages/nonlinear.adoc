== A model problem

We consider the following nonlinear Poisson equation:
[stem]
++++
-\nabla \cdot(k(u) \nabla u)=f
++++
stem:[k(u)] makes the equation nonlinear if is not constant in stem:[u]. 
In order to verify the solution procedure, we choose the domain, stem:[k(u), f,] and the boundary conditions such that we have a simple, exact solution stem:[u]. 
Denote stem:[\Omega] the unit hypercube stem:[[0,1\]^{d}] in stem:[d] dimensions, stem:[k(u)=(1+u)^{m}, f=0, u=0] for stem:[x_{0}=0, u=1] for stem:[x_{0}=1,] and stem:[\partial u / \partial n=0] at all other boundaries stem:[x_{i}=0] and stem:[x_{i}=1, i=1, \ldots, d-1 .] 
The coordinates are now represented by the symbols stem:[x_{0}, \ldots, x_{d-1}] . 
The exact solution is then
[stem]
++++
u\left(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{d}\right)=\left(\left(2^{m+1}-1\right) x_{0}+1\right)^{1 /(m+1)}-1
++++
The variational formulation of our model problem reads: find stem:[u \in V] such that
[stem]
++++
F(u ; v)=0 \quad \forall v \in V_0
++++
where
[stem]
++++
F(u ; v)=\int_{\Omega} k(u) \nabla u \cdot \nabla v d x
++++
and
[stem]
++++
\begin{array}{l}
V_0=\left\{v \in H^{1}(\Omega): v=0 \text { on } x_{0}=0 \text { and } x_{0}=1\right\} \\
V=\left\{v \in H^{1}(\Omega): v=0 \text { on } x_{0}=0 \text { and } v=1 \text { on } x_{0}=1\right\}
\end{array}
++++
The discrete problem arises as usual by restricting stem:[V] and stem:[V_0] to a pair of discrete spaces. 
The problem reads:
find stem:[u \in V] such that
[stem]
++++
F(u ; v)=0 \quad \forall v \in V_0
++++
with stem:[u=\sum_{j=1}^{N} U_{j} \phi_{j}] where stem:[U=(U_j)^T_{j=1,...,N}] are the components of stem:[u] in the basis stem:[(\phi_j)_{j=1,...,N}] of stem:[V].
We have a system of nonlinear algebraic equations to solve.

== Picard strategy

The Picard strategy is also known as the _method of successive substitutions_. 

Picard iteration is an easy way of handling nonlinear PDEs: it uses a known, previous solution in the nonlinear terms so that these terms become linear in the unknown stem:[u]. 

For our particular problem, we use a known, previous solution in the coefficient stem:[k(u)]. 
Given a solution stem:[u^{n}] from iteration stem:[n], we seek a new (hopefully improved) solution stem:[u^{n+1}] in iteration stem:[n+1] such that stem:[u^{n+1}] solves the linear problem
[stem]
++++
\nabla \cdot\left(k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla u^{n+1}\right)=0, \quad n=0,1, \ldots
++++
The iterations require an initial guess stem:[u^{0}]. The hope is that stem:[u^{n} \rightarrow u] as stem:[n \rightarrow \infty,] and that stem:[u^{n+1}] is sufficiently close to the exact solution stem:[u] of the discrete problem after just a few iterations.

We can formulate a variational problem for stem:[u^{n+1}]. 
Equivalently, we can approximate stem:[k(u)] by stem:[k\left(u^{n}\right)]  to obtain the same linear variational problem. 
In both cases, the problem consists of seeking stem:[u^{n+1} \in V] such that
[stem]
++++
\tilde{F}\left(u^{n+1} ; v\right)=0 \quad \forall v \in V_0, \quad n=0,1, \ldots
++++
with
[stem]
++++
\tilde{F}\left(u^{n+1} ; v\right)=\int_{\Omega} k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla u^{n+1} \cdot \nabla v 
++++
since this is a linear problem in the unknown stem:[u^{n+1}], we can equivalently use the formulation
[stem]
++++
a\left(u^{n+1}, v\right)=\ell(v)
++++
with
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
a(u, v) &=\int_{\Omega} k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \\
\ell(v) &=0
\end{aligned}
++++
The iterations can be stopped when stem:[\epsilon \equiv\left\|u^{n+1}-u^{n}\right\|<\varepsilon]] , where stem:[\varepsilon] is small, say stem:[10^{-5}], or when the number of iterations exceed some critical limit. 
The latter case will detect divergence of the method or unacceptable slow convergence.

In the solution algorithm we only need to store stem:[u^{n}] and stem:[u^{n+1}]. 


== Newton strategy at the algebraic level

After having discretized our nonlinear PDE problem, we may use Newton's method to solve the system of nonlinear algebraic equations. 
From the continuous variational problem, the discrete version results in a system of equations for the unknown parameters stem:[U_{1}, \ldots, U_{N}] (by inserting stem:[\left.u=\sum_{j=1}^{N} U_{j} \phi_{j} \text { and } v=\hat{\phi}_{i} \right)]

[[F_i]]
[stem]
++++
F_{i}\left(U_{1}, \ldots, U_{N}\right) \equiv \sum_{j=1}^{N} \int_{\Omega}\left(k\left(\sum_{\ell=1}^{N} U_{\ell} \phi_{\ell}\right) \nabla \phi_{j} U_{j}\right) \cdot \nabla \hat{\phi}_{i} \mathrm{d} x=0, \quad i=1, \ldots, N
++++
Newton's method for the system stem:[F_{i}\left(U_{1}, \ldots, U_{j}\right)=0, i=1, \ldots, N] can be formulated as
[[der_incr]]
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{\partial}{\partial U_{j}} F_{i}\left(U_{1}^{n}, \ldots, U_{N}^{n}\right) \delta U_{j} &=-F_{i}\left(U_{1}^{n}, \ldots, U_{N}^{n}\right), \quad i=1, \ldots, N \\
U_{j}^{k+1} &=U_{j}^{n}+\omega \delta U_{j}, \quad j=1, \ldots, N
\end{aligned}
++++
where stem:[\omega \in[0,1]] is a relaxation parameter, and stem:[n] is an iteration index. An initial guess stem:[u^{0}] must be provided to start the algorithm. 
The original Newton method has stem:[\omega=1], but in problems where it is difficult to obtain convergence, so-called under-relaxation with stem:[\omega<1] may help.

We need to compute the Jacobian matrix stem:[\partial F_{i} / \partial U_{j}] and the right-hand side vector stem:[-F_{i} .] 
Our present problem has stem:[F_{i}] given by <<F_i>>.
The derivative stem:[\partial F_{i} / \partial U_{j}] becomes
[[der_incr_2]]
[stem]
++++
\int_{\Omega}\left[k^{\prime}\left(\sum_{\ell=1}^{N} U_{\ell}^{n} \phi_{\ell}\right) \phi_{j} \nabla\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N} U_{j}^{n} \phi_{j}\right) \cdot \nabla \hat{\phi}_{i}+k\left(\sum_{\ell=1}^{N} U_{\ell}^{n} \phi_{\ell}\right) \nabla \phi_{j} \cdot \nabla \hat{\phi}_{i}\right] 
++++
The following results were used to obtain <<der_incr_2>>
[stem]
++++
\frac{\partial u}{\partial U_{j}}=\frac{\partial}{\partial U_{j}} \sum_{j=1}^{N} U_{j} \phi_{j}=\phi_{j}, \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial U_{j}} \nabla u=\nabla \phi_{j,} \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial U_{j}} k(u)=k^{\prime}(u) \phi_{j}
++++

We can reformulate the Jacobian matrix in <<der>> by introducing the short notation stem:[u^{n}=\sum_{j=1}^{N} U_{j}^{n} \phi_{j}]
[stem]
++++
\frac{\partial F_{i}}{\partial U_{j}}=\int_{\Omega}\left[k^{\prime}\left(u^{n}\right) \phi_{j} \nabla u^{n} \cdot \nabla \hat{\phi}_{i}+k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla \phi_{j} \cdot \nabla \hat{\phi}_{i}\right] 
++++

We need to formulate a corresponding variational problem. 
Looking at the linear system of equations in Newton's method,
[stem]
++++
\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{\partial F_{i}}{\partial U_{j}} \delta U_{j}=-F_{i}, \quad i=1, \ldots, N
++++
we can introduce stem:[v] as a general test function replacing stem:[\hat{\phi}_{i}], and we can identify the unknown stem:[\delta u=] stem:[\sum_{j=1}^{N} \delta U_{j} \phi_{j} .] 
From the linear system we can now go "backwards" to construct the corresponding discrete weak form
[[disc_form]]
[stem]
++++
\int_{\Omega}\left[k^{\prime}\left(u^{n}\right) \delta u \nabla u^{n} \cdot \nabla v+k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla \delta u \cdot \nabla v\right] =-\int_{\Omega} k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla u^{n} \cdot \nabla v \mathrm{d} x
++++
Equation <<discr_form>> fits the standard form stem:[a(\delta u, v)=\ell(v)] with
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
a(\delta u, v) &=\int_{\Omega}\left[k^{\prime}\left(u^{n}\right) \delta u \nabla u^{n} \cdot \nabla v+k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla \delta u \cdot \nabla v\right] \mathrm{d} x \\
\ell(v) &=-\int_{\Omega} k\left(u^{n}\right) \nabla u^{n} \cdot \nabla v 
\end{aligned}
++++

NOTE: the important feature in Newton's method that the previous solution stem:[u^{n}] replaces stem:[u] in the formulas when computing the matrix stem:[\partial F_{i} / \partial U_{j}] and vector stem:[F_{i}] for the linear system in each Newton iteration.

=== Implementation of Newton method
